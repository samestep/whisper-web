This is my class project for the CMU [05-618 Human-AI Interaction][haii] class
in Fall 2022: a web interface to the [OpenAI Whisper][whisper] model. I hosted a
copy of the model on AWS Lambda for a while but eventually took it down. After
making this, though, I found a project to package Whisper into WebAssembly, so
if you want to run that in your browser then you can try it here:
