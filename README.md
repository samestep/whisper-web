# whisper-web

My class project for the CMU [05-618 Human-AI
Interaction](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/haii-cmu) class in Fall
2022: a web interface to the [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)
model. Originally this was meant to be something much cooler (specifically, the
entirety of Whisper packaged into WebAssembly), but that turned out to be too
hard for me to do, so here we are.
